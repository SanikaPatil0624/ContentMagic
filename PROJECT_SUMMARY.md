## 🔑 OpenAI API Setup (Optional)

The app works with mock data by default. For real AI-powered content:

1. Get an API key from https://platform.openai.com/
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
   PORT=3001
   ```
3. Restart the server

---

## 📊 Data Storage

Posts are stored **in-memory** on the backend server. This is the optimal choice for this project because:
- ✅ **Fast and simple** - No setup required
- ✅ **Perfect for content generation** - Users copy content and use it elsewhere
- ✅ **Session-based workflow** - Fresh start each session
- ✅ **No external dependencies** - Works immediately
- ℹ️ Data clears on server restart (by design)

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Colors
Edit `tailwind.config.js` to customize the color scheme.

### Add More Platforms
Update the `platforms` array in `ContentGenerator.jsx`.

### Add More Tones
Update the `tones` array in `ContentGenerator.jsx`.

### Modify AI Prompts
Edit the prompt in `server/index.js` to customize AI responses.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Port already in use?**
```bash
# Find process using port 3001
netstat -ano | findstr :3001

# Kill the process (replace PID)
taskkill /F /PID <PID>
```

**Dependencies not installed?**
```bash
npm install
```

**Frontend not connecting to backend?**
Check that both servers are running and the proxy is configured in `vite.config.js`.
